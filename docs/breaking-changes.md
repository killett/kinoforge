# Breaking changes

(Moved from README §Breaking changes (Layer T cloud store.kind routing, Layer M engine.hosted.model removed) on 2026-06-27. See [../README.md](../README.md).)

## Breaking changes

### Layer T — cloud `store.kind` now routes the ledger too

Operators who configured `store.kind: s3` (or `gcs`) for artifacts but
expected the instance ledger to remain on local disk: the ledger now
lives in the configured store. Same authentication, same bucket; the
sidecar at `<state-dir>/store.json` records the routing.

Detection: kinoforge hard-blocks the first cloud-routed command if your
local state directory still has tracked instances. See
[Migration from a local ledger](#migration-from-a-local-ledger) for the
4-step procedure.

Non-breaking for: operators on `store.kind: local` (default), operators
on fresh state directories, and operators who already had no in-flight
local instances.

### Layer M — `engine.hosted.model` removed; use top-level `spec.model`

Hosted configs that previously declared the model identifier under
`engine.hosted.model` must move the value to top-level `spec.model`. The
two locations carried the same string in every shipped config, with a
"keep these in sync" comment block as the only safeguard. Layer M
collapses them: `spec.model` is now the single source of truth, read both
by `HostedAPIBackend.submit` (wire body) and by
`HostedAPIEngine.key_base` (cache identity).

Migration:

```diff
 engine:
   kind: hosted
   hosted:
     provider: my-shim
     endpoint: "https://shim/inference"
-    model: "wan-ai/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B"
     api_key_env: "MY_SHIM_KEY"
     health_url: "https://shim/health"
     url_path: video.url

 spec:
   model: "wan-ai/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B"
```

Failure mode: configs still carrying `engine.hosted.model` raise a
load-time `ValidationError` with the message
`"engine.hosted.model is no longer supported; move the value to
top-level spec.model"`.
